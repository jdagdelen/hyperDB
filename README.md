## Advantages
* Simple interface compatible with _all_ large language model agents. 
* Highly optimized C++ backend vector store with HW accelerated operations via MKL BLAS. 
* Enables users to index documents with advanced features such as _ids_ and _metadata_.

## Installation

Install the package from PyPI:

```bash
pip install hyperdb-python
```

## Optional dependency for locally embedding

If you want to use Hugging Face models with this package, you need to install the `sentence-transformers` package:

```bash
pip install sentence-transformers
```

## Usage

Here's an example of using HyperDB to store and query documents with information about all 151 original pokemon _in an instant_:

```python
import json
from hyperdb import HyperDB

# Load documents from the JSONL file
documents = []

with open("demo/pokemon.jsonl", "r") as f:
    for line in f:
        documents.append(json.loads(line))

# Instantiate HyperDB with the list of documents
db = HyperDB(documents, key="info.description")

# Save the HyperDB instance to a file
db.save("demo/pokemon_hyperdb.pickle.gz")

# Load the HyperDB instance from the save file
db.load("demo/pokemon_hyperdb.pickle.gz")

# Query the HyperDB instance with a text input
results = db.query("Likes to sleep.", top_k=5)
```
